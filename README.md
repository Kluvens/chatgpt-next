This is a clone of [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/chatgpt/) in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The project has been deployed on Vercel and it is now available [here](https://chatgpt-next-justin.vercel.app/).

Now this project has integrated robust CI/CD, insightful web analytics and speed checks. With the main branch updated, the deployed version will be automated.
